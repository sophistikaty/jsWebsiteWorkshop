Welcome! Here's how this is going to work
------------------------------------------------------------
Welcome! (about me, about you) - html,css,js? website? developer?
	Concept Overview, (monarch atlas)
		Setup / Make Friends (plz help your neighbor, kthx), 
			Start files,
				Experiment, 
					Recap, 
						Opportunities to Connect, 
							Thanks for coming!

	First, you'll need 3 things:
	------------------------------------------------------------
		
		1. A text editor (like sublime text 2: http://www.sublimetext.com/2)

		2. A google drive/ docs account 
			-visit https://drive.google.com
			-create a new spreadsheet (See google doc section below)

		3. A github account
			-visit https://github.com/
			- command line or gui? (See github section below)

		


	Set up your google doc
	------------------------------------------------------------

		- https://drive.google.com/drive/my-drive
		- new spreadsheet
		- File > publish to the web
		- choose your settings 
		- click "start publishing button"
		- copy link! (ie: https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1N9R5aj-MewuXuDxPF_tZmA57bapbiu3dx-ToqFu6OKg/pubhtml)


	Set up your github repo
	------------------------------------------------------------

		- https://github.com/[your-user-name] > repositories > new
			- command line or gui?
				- download github desktop app: https://desktop.github.com/

	- fork and/or take a look at tabletop.js: https://github.com/jsoma/tabletop

	(deployment) - ** Setup Github Pages ** 
					--- Command-line instructions via github
						- https://pages.github.com/ 
						- suggested to choose project site > start from scratch

					--- My quick instructions
						- sign-in, select the repository you just created
						- create a new branch called "gh-pages"
						- **! must have index.html file in root-directory !**
						- as you make changes to your local copy of the repo, they'll appear in the changes panel.
						-commit all changes to master, then merge them to the gh-pages branch to publish them live on http://[your-user-name].github.io/[your-repo-name]
